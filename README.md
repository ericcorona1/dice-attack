# Dice Attack

## Objective

Engage in a strategic dice battle with an opponent using a set of 6 dice.

## Phases of Gameplay

### Phase 1 - Dice Selection

- Choose 6 dice from the following types:
  - d4
  - d6
  - d8
  - d10
  - d12
  - d20

### Phase 2 - Attack Phase

- The attacking player picks a die from the defending player to target.
- Choose the attacking die or dice.
- There are 2 types of attacks:
  - **Greater Than Attack:** Use one die with a greater value than the defending die.
  - **Equal to Attack:** Use 2 or more dice that add up to the exact value of the defending die.
- After attacking play switches to the other player.
- Play continues until no more moves can be made.

## Scoring

- The player with the most points wins.
- Points are based on both captured and remaining dice.
- Captured dice are worth points equal to the number of sides they have.
- Remaining dice contribute 1 point each, with points increasing for each additional die.
  - The first remaining die is worth 1 point.
  - The second remaining die is worth 2 points.
  - Subsequent dice follow this pattern.

May the most strategic player emerge victorious!
